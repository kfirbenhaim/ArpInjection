# ArpInjection
Just a POC that was done for fun & to learn :) \
This system injects arp reply to both attacked sides, and transfers the data of both sides via the attacker's computer. Implements Man In The Middle attack.
Run the system by running the main.py file.
I used impacket for parsing and pcap for communicating with the network interface card, but you can change the implementation modules via the main.py file.
